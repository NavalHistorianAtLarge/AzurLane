    <h1>Amagi</h1>
    <div class="text">
        <p>Amagi is the beloved nee-sama of Akagi. She was to be converted to an aircraft carrier with her sisters, but because of a weak wisdom cube, she gives the opportunity to Kaga. Amagi is brilliant as a strategist, and a very warm and kind person. Amagi is the only shipgirl assumed dead in the game. She continues to be hinted at and whispered at even now, over thirty years since her demise.</p>

        <h3>Crimson Echoes: Debue Event</h3>

        <p>Amagi is a brilliant strategist and chess player, winning every time against a more reckless Kaga. She and Kaga are the competitors in two exercise competitions to see who will next lead the Sakura Empire.</p>

        <p>In the first excercise, Amagi fights Hatakaze, Naka, and finally Kaga. She gives advice to those who compete against her. Her brilliance in strategy not only at the chessboard but also on the battlefield makes one wish her cube was whole, as her wise mind has potential to lead the Sakura Empire well.</p>

        <p>After the excersize, Amagi discoveres that Akagi and Kaga are fighting beside the notice-board. Through a terrifying anger, she forces them to make peace and hold hands. Cooperation between members of the Sakura Empire is of utmost importance to Amagi.</p>

        <p>Kaga is devestated to learn that she will be converted to a floating nest, unable to take offensive with her main guns. Determined to go out in the blaze of glory that has been denied her, she rushes to a solo attack on the sirens, leaving behind a suicide note that Ashigara brings to Amagi.</p>

        <p>Frustrated by Kaga's stupdity, Amagi rushes to the rescue. She tells Kaga that Kaga can survive if she can make it back to port and win the next war game. As the group voyages back, they are attacked by a Siren carrier. Bombs fall on Amagi. Kaga tows her back to port, despite Amagi calling her a fool and desiring to be left to her fate. However, the battle weakens her body and upon returning, she becomes bed-ridden.</p>

        <p>After Amagi recovers, Amagi asks Nagato for a re-run of the excerise, desiring to sacrafice herself for Kaga due to her own weak wisdom cube. Kaga and Amagi undertake an excersize once more. This time, to Amagi's satisfaction, Kaga wins, assuring the former that Kaga can lead the Sakura Empire to victory. Amagi entrusts the Sakura Empire and her sister Akagi to Kaga's care. Sometime afterwards, she dies of her cube defect.</p>

        <p>Before her death, Amagi gives Akagi and Kaga matching brooches.</p>
